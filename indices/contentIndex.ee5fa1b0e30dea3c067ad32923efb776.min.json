Three rings will cover the floor, and magic circles containing either triangles or rectangles will appear at every clock position around the outer edge of the arena. Triangles will correspond to a conal AoE originating from the magic circle and rectangles will correspond to a half-room cleave originating from the magic circle, similar to Exoterikos from EX1.\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cp class=\"center\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_triangle.png\" width=\"40%\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_rectangle.png\" width=\"40%\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n\u003e To know which AoEs are being activated, you will need to trace the blue line maze from the center to the outer edge and see which magic circle that it connects to. As an added complication, the boss will rotate one or more of the circles containing lines 1/8th turn clockwise or counterclockwise, as indicated by the curved arrows that appear on the circles. One major change from the Normal version is that if the outer ring rotates, so do the AoEs, so keep that in mind.\n\u003e While this mechanic does happen in multiple different patterns throughout the fight, each instance has some things that are always true that make it easier to resolve each time.\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cp class=\"center\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_purgations.png\" width=\"60%\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n### 1st Pattern\n\n\u003e This will always be only one shape, and the inner and outer circles will always be rotating. Solve the pattern based on where the lines and AoEs will end up and stand in the safe area for that shape - since it's only ever one, there's slightly more time to solve this.\n\n### 2nd Pattern\n\n\u003e This will always be two shapes at a 90-degree angle from each other, and the outer circle is always rotating. So far, I've only seen this to end up as 2 rectangles, making the safe spot always directly opposite the \"elbow\" of the V shape made by the lines in the inner circle. In the even it's two triangles, however, the safe spot is simply between the two active triangles.\n\n### 3rd Pattern\n\n\u003e All shapes are triangles, and there are always two activated. They will either be directly adjacent to each other, or 90-degrees separated like the second pattern, depending on whether the center circle ends up connecting to a squiggly line or not - only the middle ring is rotating. For all patterns, you only have to solve for one triangle as directly next to either active triangle is always safe.\n\n### 4th Pattern\n\n\u003e This is always all rectangles, and there are always two activated. One rectangle will always be at a 45-degree angle to the other, making the safe spot always resolve as a single 1/8th \"pizza slice\". Only the middle ring will rotate.\n\n### 5th Pattern\n\n\u003e Only one shape is active, and both the inner and middle circles are rotating opposite each other. No trick here, just solve the pattern based on rotations.\n\n### 6th Pattern\n\n\u003e Two shapes will activate, always one triangle and one rectangle directly adjacent. Only the middle circle will rotate. The safe spot for this is always a small triangle on the same side of the arena as the active triangle, across from the fire.\n\n## Arch Inferno\n\n\u003e Initial safe spots will always be on intercards. Group 1 goes north, Group 2 goes south. The AoEs around the edge will start moving, forcing you to rotate around the boss constantly for the duration of the mechanic. While these AoEs are moving, 2 of 3 additional mechanics will happen at random. Immediately after the first random mechanic, a line AoE will appear through the boss, just dodge the danger bacon. Immediately after the final circle AoE explodes, there will be a conal cleave from the boss on each player (Radial Flagration is  the cast), so get into your clock spots.\n\n### Random Mechanics {.center}\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cp class=\"center\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_arch_spread.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_arch_stack.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_arch_enumeration.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n\u003e 2 of these mechanics will happen at random during Arch Inferno, they're fairly self explanatory:\n\u003e\n\u003e - Spread: puddles will drop around you, simply spread out in the safe area DPS right/Support left, with Healers/Ranged taking their spreads further out to allow for uptime.\n\u003e - Stack Markers: groups will stack on healers in their respective sides of the boss\n\u003e - Enumerations: 2-person stacks, Tanks/Melee will stack close to the boss while Healers/Ranged will stack further back\n\n## Adds Phase\n\n\u003e 6 adds will spawn, 5 small ones and one large one. The large add in center will repeatedly cast raidwides with a stacking fire vuln debuff, so focus it down first. The small add directly north will repeatedly cast random small circle AoEs to dodge on the ground, so take it out second. From there, you can pretty much just go clockwise.\n\u003e\n\u003e The two northeast/northwest adds will put out orange tethers that end in a small AoE tankbuster to whoever they're tethered to - tanks should take the tethers and move away from the party.\n\u003e\n\u003e The two southeast/southwest adds will make a purple tether to a random player that ends in a conal cleave from the add - tethered players should point these south outside the arena to avoid cleaving the party.\n\u003e\n\u003e Immediately after killing all the adds, Rubicante will become targetable again and begin casting a massive raidwide. Heal, shield, and mitigate, and prepare for phase 2.\n\n## Flamerake\n\n\u003e This mechanic combines a cross-shaped exaflare AoE with debuffs that will result in AoEs once their timers end. Each player will get up to 2 debuffs that resolve at different times. 4 players will get a flare (triangle shaped debuff), 1 player will get a stack (X shaped/stack marker debuff), and all 8 players will get a spread puddle (circle shaped). To resolve:\n\u003e - Preposition in clock spots and wait for the spinning cross to stop. This will either be pointed in a + shape and hit cardinals, or an X shape and hit intercardinals. If it is hitting your clock spot, rotate clockwise into the safe area.\n\u003e - After the first hit, the safe spots will be in a # shape. If you have a flare debuff, take your flare to the outer edge of the arena in the safe zone to explode. If you have a stack debuff or only one debuff, stack in the center.\n\u003e - After the second hit, the safe spot will be only in the center of the arena. Puddles will explode at this time, so stay spread in roughly your clock position at max melee.\n\n### Cardinals {.center}\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cp class=\"center\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_flamerake_1.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_flamerake_2.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_flamerake_3.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n### Intercardinals {.center}\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cp class=\"center\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_flamerake_cross_1.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_flamerake_cross_2.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_flamerake_cross_3.png\" width=\"28%\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n\u003e The flare/stack is also role based, so it will either be DPS in/Support out, or Support in/DPS out.\n\n### Inferno {.center}\n\n\u003e While Rubicante is cosplaying as Sephiroth, Inferno is a spread mechanic that leaves a bleed debuff, NOT a raidwide. Immediately after resolving Flamerake, just stand in your clockspots and heal up.\n\n## Scalding Ring/Signal\n\n\u003e The mechanic changes based on the castbar name. Scalding Ring will be a donut AoE, and Scalding Signal will be point-blank. At the same time, line AoEs will go out to each player, so to resolve, stand in your clockspots.\n\n### Sweeping Immolation {.center}\n\n\u003e The boss will turn and cleave half the arena in front of him. He will also perform two secondary mechanics at the same time - the clones that spawned at the outside of the arena after the previous line AoEs will do a second dash through (if clockspots were done correctly previously, you can use the lines on the floor), and there will either be a stack or spread based on the pattern on his wing. If there is one large flower, stack in one of the safe slices. If there are multiple flowers, spread based on the pattern below:\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cp class=\"center\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/ex5_sweeping_spread.png\" width=\"60%\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n###  Dualfire {.center}\n\n\u003e Simple 100-degree conal tankbuster on both tanks. Tanks will take these NE/NW and mit while party stacks south.\n\n## Flamespire Claw (Everyone will call this Limit Cut but they're wrong)\n\n\u003e Players will receive a number marker on their head from 1 through 8, indicating the order in which they will receive a large conal cleave. While these cleaves are happening, there are 2 persistent grabbable tethers coming from the boss that will give a stacking Flamespire debuff. If you reach 5 stacks, the party will wipe.

There's a decently spicy DoT attached to this, but it's not too bad if mitigated. Immediately following is _Soul Grasp_, a multi-hit stacked tankbuster. The last bit of bleed is still ticking during this, so watch out for your tanks. Once this is done, heal up to prepare for the first _Dividing Wings_.\n\n## Dividing Wings I\n\nThere's technically two separate mechanics here that are combining into one resolution - _Dividing Wings_, which spawns two winged staves that will tether to one random support and one random DPS and shoot a wide cleave AoE at them (looks to be about 120°), and _Steel Web_, which will mark 2 other random support/DPS players with a stack AoE that will form webs between the affected players.\n\nThere's a couple different ways to resolve this, but my favorite is with the tethered players North. The tethered players will stand 2 tiles North and 1 tile closer to the outside from their staff, and the remaining players will role stack in a triangle formation with the stack AoE players 1 tile to the outside from the staves (see diagram).\n\n{{\u003c figure src=\"/notes/images/p10s_dividing1.png\" link=\"/notes/images/p10s_dividing1.png\" class=\"center\" width=\"60%\" \u003e}}\n\nOnce this all goes off, the players hit by _Steel Web_ will be tethered together by, well, webs. The free players will need to run through these webs to break them and free the tethered players. Additionally, the players hit by the wing cleaves will get another DoT on them - this one isn't TOO spicy, but you will need to keep an eye on it.\n\nThis is followed by either a _Pandæmon's Holy_ or _Circles of Pandæmonium_ cast - _Holy_ is a point blank (out), and _Circles_ is a donut (in).\n\n## Wicked Step\n\nAfter all this is _Wicked Step_. These will be tank towers on the left and right of the arena, with a twist - the towers will send you flying in a line from their origin point. Oh, and there's a decently spicy DoT this time, beware. To resolve, the tanks will soak the towers to the north and closer to the center (so, West tower is soaked with the tank NE, and vice versa) to be knocked back to the opposite small platform.\n\nTo get the tanks back home, the boss will helpfully cast _Entangling Web_. Both tanks, a random healer, and a random DPS will be targeted with web AoE baits. If you bait these such that they overlap both one of the pillars on either side of the gap, and each other, they'll create a web bridge to walk across the poison puddles. In general, healers go left, DPS go right, it's not too hard.\n\n{{\u003c figure src=\"/notes/images/p10s_entangling_web.png\" link=\"/notes/images/p10s_entangling_web.png\" class=\"center\" width=\"60%\" caption=\"The main thing to watch out for is that the AoE puddles **need** to overlap a bit - if they don't, a bridge won't be formed.\"\u003e}}\n\n## Pandæmoniac Pillars\n\nOnce the web bridges are formed, everyone mosey back center for _Pandæmoniac Pillars_ - these will be tower soaks, follow your positions from [Setup](notes/P10S%20-%20Pandæmonium/#setup). After soaking your towers, cheat back close to the middle, and watch for the castbar. The boss will once again cast either _Holy_ or _Circles_, making either the front or middle row safe, and then the towers will randomly spawn either donut or point blank AoEs. This happens **VERY** quickly, and you don't have much time to adjust - I've found the easiest way to solve this is to cheat towards the safe lane before the towers appear, then keep an eye out for the large ones with chains (the point blanks). They're much easier to see at a glance than the donuts, so you can just dodge away from those into a donut tower.\n\n## Silkspit","lastmodified":"2023-09-28T00:05:58.538739259Z","tags":null},"/notes/P11S-Themis":{"title":"P11S - Themis","content":"---\n\n# Encounter Info\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cdiv class=\"admonitionDiv\"\u003e\n\t\u003cp class=\"admonitionDamageHeader\"\u003e\n\t\tDPS Check\n\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp class=\"admonitionDamageBody\"\u003e\n\t\t73.6k\n\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\u003cp class=\"admonitionEnrageHeader\"\u003e\n\t\tEnrage\n\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003cp class=\"admonitionEnrageBody\"\u003e\n\t\t11:15\n\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n# Strategy Reference\n\nThemis opens the fight with some pretty standard stuff, starting with an _Eunomia_ raidwide that has a bleed. This is decently spicy, so make sure to keep an eye on that. Immediately after is _Dike_, a 2-hit tankbuster on both tanks that requires a swap during the castbar. We then start in on the first set of _Overruling_ mechanics.\n\n## Phase 1\n\nThere are a total of four different _Overruling_ mechanics throughout the fight - since the main difference between all of them is the first word, I'm going to just refer to them with that after introducing them. The main commonality between all of them is that Themis will glow with either **Light** or **Dark** energy while casting the mechanic to indicate one of two possible patterns.\n\nIn general, **Light** versions of _Overrulings_ will result in going away from a point-blank AoE and soaking in light parties, and **Dark** versions will result in going to the center of a donut AoE and soaking in partners.\n\n\u003e**Light** = Light parties + out\n\u003e\n\u003e**Dark** = Partners (doubles) + in\n{.centerfig}\n\n### Jury Overruling{.center}\n\n{{\u003c figure src=\"/notes/images/p11s-jurystart.png\" link=\"/notes/images/p11s-jurystart.png\" class=\"center\" width=\"50%\" caption=\"Starting clock positions\"\u003e}}\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cfigure class=\"center\"\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"/notes/images/p11s-jurylight.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/p11s-jurylight.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"40%\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"/notes/images/p11s-jurydark.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/p11s-jurydark.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"40%\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003eLight (left) and Dark (right) positions after the initial protean cleaves are baited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n_Jury_ is the first _Overruling_ mechanic in this phase and is repeated throughout the fight. Light or Dark, it always starts with line proteans from the boss which are taken in clock spots at max melee.\n\n**Light:** For the Light version, after proteans you'll drop point-blank AoEs underneath your positions. There will also be a light party stack, so to resolve, simply move in in your light parties.\n\n**Dark:** For the Dark version, after proteans you'll drop donut AoEs under your positions. There are partner stacks directly after, so supports rotate clockwise to their DPS partner who stays in their clock spot.\n\n### Upheld Overruling{.center}\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cfigure class=\"center\"\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"/notes/images/p11s-upheldlight1.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/p11s-upheldlight1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"40%\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"/notes/images/p11s-upheldlight2.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/p11s-upheldlight2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"40%\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003eLight version\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"center\"\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"/notes/images/p11s-uphelddark1.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/p11s-uphelddark1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"40%\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"/notes/images/p11s-uphelddark2.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/p11s-uphelddark2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"40%\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003eDark version\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n_Upheld_ will start with a tether on a random(ish) player that will indicate who the mechanic is originating from. Regardless of what version it is, the tethered player should move to the center of the boss's hitbox.\n\n**Light:** A random player is tethered for a full-party stack. Immediately afterwards, a large point-blank AoE and light parties will happen, so resolve in your light parties at max melee East/West.\n\n**Dark:** A random tank is targeted for a large AoE tankbuster (use cooldowns!). All others stand max melee in your partner stacks. Once the tankbuster has gone off, move inside to dodge a donut AoE and resolve partner stacks. (The tethered tank will just move to their partner stack position from center.)\n\n### Divisive Overruling{.center}\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cfigure class=\"center\"\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"/notes/images/p11s-divisivelight1.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/p11s-divisivelight1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"40%\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"/notes/images/p11s-divisivelight2.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/p11s-divisivelight2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"40%\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003eLight version\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"center\"\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"/notes/images/p11s-divisivedark1.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/p11s-divisivedark1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"40%\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"/notes/images/p11s-divisivedark2.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/p11s-divisivedark2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"40%\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003eDark version\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n_Divisive_ will start with Themis casting a line AoE slightly smaller than the size of his hitbox directly in front and back of him, followed by the usual secondary Light or Dark mechanics.\n\n**Light:** The line AoE will go off again, but much larger, at the same time as light parties.

_Gluttony's Augur_, which simply deals moderate raidwide damage, followed shortly by _Ravening_, which signals a phase transition, and deals moderate raidwide damage after a 5 second delay. These phases are always in order, starting with **Mage's Lament**.\n\n## Mage's Lament - Part 1\n\nThe first Mage phase (denoted by the Blue buff on the boss) will open with a 2-hit AoE tankbuster on both tanks that will require a swap (_Duality of Death_) - make sure to be NW/NE away from the party, and provoke during the castbar.\n\nDirectly following will be a series of three _Dualspell_ casts (explained below). The element order on these is fixed to always be Fire \u003e Lightning \u003e Fire, but which element is empowered is random, with the exception that the 1st and the 3rd will always be opposite each other (so if Ice is empowered first, Fire will be empowered second).\n\nThe final _Dualspell_ is the end of this phase, and the boss will cast _Ravening_ once more to transition into **Martialist's Lament**.\n\n### Dualspell{.center}\n\n\u003eThe boss will begin charging two elements that can be seen on his hands - this will always be a combination of an Ice element donut AoE, and either Fire (AoE on 4 random players, always all DPS or all support), or Lightning (line AoE on every player). Getting hit by any of these leaves a magic vuln, so if you get hit by 2 (either by getting clipped by the Ice donut, or overlapping the baited AoEs), you will die.\n\u003e\n\u003eEach Dualspell cast will also have one of the two elements be empowered, indicated by a colored sigil that matches the element flashing on the screen (Blue for Ice, Red for Fire, and Purple for Lightning). Whichever element is empowered will end up having a much larger AoE effect, just like in Normal.\n\u003e\n\u003eCombining this, essentially what this means is you have 2 pieces of information you need to solve the mechanic - Fire vs. Lightning (partner stacks vs. clocks), and Ice or Not Ice (in or out). As usual, There Are Lines On The Floor to help you with this - if Ice is empowered, you'll want to stand on the inside of the inner circle, otherwise, stand on the inside of the second circle.\n\n## Martialist's Lament\n\nThe Martialist phase (Red buff on boss) will open with 4 walls being spawned on either cardinals or intercardinals, followed by _Ascendant Fist_, a single-hit tankbuster that will apply a DoT and Physical vuln effect, requiring a tank swap.\n\nImmediately after, the boss will cast _Archaic Rockbreaker_ - this will cause a knockback from the center of the arena that has a pushback greater than the distance to the edge of the arena. To resolve this, you'll need to get knocked back into the walls that have spawned with your same partner from Fire in _Dualspell_, as the knockback is followed by a 2-person stack AoE.\n\nThis is followed up immediately again by either _Front Combination_ or _Rear Combination_. There will either be a donut (in) or point blank (out) indicator on the floor, followed by a 180-degree cleave either in front or behind the boss (signaled by the cast name), which is then followed by the opposite to the first AoE. This essentially means there's a total of four possible patterns:\n\n\u003e Donut \u003e Front OR Rear cleave \u003e Point blank\n\u003e\n\u003eOR\n\u003e\n\u003ePoint blank \u003e Front OR Rear cleave \u003e Donut\n{.centerfig}\n\nAt the same time that _Front/Rear Combination_ AoEs are going off, there will be cracks on the floor that have glowing lines growing through them. When these lines reach their end, they'll explode in a large AoE around the tip, meaning you'll have to dodge both at once. This will happen twice, and both times the AoEs from the lines will go off at the same time as the in/out from _Combination_. There will be a split second to adjust before the line AoEs explode, but the snapshot is very tight. There is also a decent amount of time to adjust before the front/rear cleave goes off, so you can dodge that after dodging the crack AoEs.\n\nBecause you're dodging both at once, there's an easy way to simplify safe spots - if the _Combination_ AoE is in, stand ON the long lines and away from the short lines. If it's out, stand on the wall near the short lines and AWAY from the long lines.\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cfigure class=\"center\"\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"/notes/images/p9s_crack_aoes.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/p9s_crack_aoes.png\" alt=\"Example of safe spots for AoEs\" width=\"40%\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"/notes/images/p9s_crack_aoes_2.png\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/p9s_crack_aoes_2.png\" alt=\"Example of safe spots for AoEs\" width=\"40%\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003eExample of safe spots for AoEs\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\nAfter all of this, there will be _Archaic Demolish_, a simple light party stack on both healers, followed by a _Gluttony's Augur_ raidwide and another _Ascendant Fist_ tankbuster. There is very little time between the stacks and raidwide, so this is a good place for heavy mit. If you've gotten past all this, it's time for **Chimera's Lament**, also known as Blitzball.\n\n## Chimera's Lament - Part 1\n\nThis phase begins with a short bit of not much while the boss casts _Levinstrike Summon_, which will spawn 4 lightning orbs at either cardinals or intercardinals, along with more walls behind them. Immediately after, he'll cast _Scramble Succession_ , which you'll often hear referred to as Limit Cut, Blitzball, soccer, FIFA, etc., and become untargetable for the duration of the mechanic. This is the first major mechanics wall in the fight.\n\n### Scrambled Succession\n\nWhat this mechanic actually does is place numbered markers 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 over the lightning orbs that were spawned, and numbered markers 2 - 4 - 6 - 8 over 4 random players. The remaining 4 players will be randomly targeted, one by one, with a large, swirling blue marker over their head. Broken down, here's what each one does:\n\n- **Lightning Orbs**: The boss will jump to each orb in order and kick it to the opposite side of the arena (so if orb 1 is at North, it will be kicked into the wall at South). Upon hitting the opposite wall, it will explode in a point blank AoE, and spawn a tower that will need to be soaked by a player. The tower will give a magic vuln debuff.\n- **Numbered Players**: At the same time that the tower from the lightning orbs resolves, the boss will jump to the numbered players in order and hit them with a small fire AoE. This AoE will also give a magic vuln debuff.\n- **Unmarked Players**: The swirling blue Defamation markers will go off in order, at the same time that the tower and fire AoEs resolve. This will ALSO give a magic vuln debuff. (Seeing a pattern?)\n\nThere will be a total of 4 sets of these mechanics, one for each lightning orb. The order will essentially be: Kick \u003e AoEs + Tower resolves \u003e party moves to new positions \u003e Repeat. There are multiple ways to solve this, but in my opinion, the simplest is the Oppo strat.\n\n#### Oppo Strat{.center}\n\n\u003eWhen the numbers spawn above everything, players with number markers will start standing on the 5 orb, directly across from 1, and will be rotating in the direction of the 7 orb. (Whether this is clockwise or counter-clockwise is random, as well as the position of the orbs relative to North.) The marked 2 player will soak their AoE away from the group, in the corner of the arena either to the left or right of the group - which side doesn't matter, so long as you aren't either hitting the party or being hit by the other mechanics. When the orb explodes and the first tower spawns, it will be soaked by the 6 player - this is to handle the magic vulns from the markers and towers. Fire baits will go in sequential order of 2 \u003e 4 \u003e 6 \u003e 8, and tower baits will be offset by 2, in order of 6 \u003e 8 \u003e 2 \u003e 4. After everything explodes, the whole party will rotate 90 degrees in the previously determined direction, and start the next set from there.\n\u003e\n\u003e An easy way to remember this is that you'll be handling a mechanic every OTHER set of AoEs. So, if you handle the first tower, you do nothing for the next set, then you'll handle your stack, then you'll do nothing for the next set.\n\u003e\n\u003eUnmarked/Defamation players will start standing on the 1 orb, rotating in the direction of the 3 orb. This will be the same rotation as the rest of the party. Your job is slightly easier - the first person marked by the Defamation marker will stay behind at the 1 orb, as close to the wall as you can be, while the rest of the party rotates. Once AoEs explode, the next person to be marked will stay behind while the remaining players rotate, and the player who was just hit can rotate in the opposite direction to rejoin the rest of the party with number markers. From here, you just rotate each time until all 4 markers have gone off.\n\n#### Hector mini-guide{.center}\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"videoEmbed\"\u003e\n\t\u003ciframe \n\t\tclass=\"videoFrame\"\n\t\twidth=\"100%\" \n\t\theight=\"100%\" \n\t\tsrc=\"https://youtube.com/embed/oSdv6f8qNA0\" \n\t\ttitle=\"\" \n\t\tframeborder=\"0\" \n\t\tallow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" \n\t\tallowfullscreen\n\t\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\nIf all of this is done correctly, congrats! You're past the hard part. The final mechanic in this phase is _Two Minds_, which is exactly like Dualspell from the first phase, except it resolves much faster. Heal up quickly and resolve based on the elements like before. This is followed by another _Gluttony's Augur_ raidwide, and another _Ravening_ phase transition into **Beast's Lament**.\n\n## Beast's Lament\n\nBeast's Lament will begin with _Charybdis_, which spawns 4 very large wind puddles at either the cardinals or intercardinals. Avoid stepping in these, as you will probably die. This is followed by _Comet_, which will spawn 4 meteors in between these puddles that will do proximity damage AoEs when they appear, so stack center and prepare for raidwide damage.\n\nTwo of these meteors will be cracked - take note of which ones. The boss will begin casting _Beastly Bile_, which will target the furthest player from the boss with a stack AoE. Shortly after, he'll also cast _Thunderbolt_, which targets the 4 closest players with a massive conal AoE. These two mechanics will resolve at the same time, at the end of the _Thunderbolt_ cast. Meteors that are hit by either of these mechanics will be damaged, with cracked meteors exploding and doing point blank AoE damage, and normal meteors becoming cracked. You do not want normal meteors to become cracked.\n\nTo resolve, 4 players (either all DPS or T/H, doesn't matter which) will bait the _Beastly Bile_ AoE at one of the cracked meteors, while the other 4 remain on their color markers in front of the wind puddles to bait the _Thunderbolt_ cones away from all meteors. Once AoEs are baited, these players will swap, with the players that baited the first _Beastly Bile_ moving to bait _Thunderbolt_ and vice versa. The second _Beastly Bile_ players will need to bait at the remaining cracked meteor.\n\n{{\u003c figure src=\"/notes/images/p9s_thunderbolt.png\" link=\"/notes/images/p9s_thunderbolt.png\" class=\"center\" width=\"40%\" caption=\"Example of bait positions\"\u003e}}\n\nAfter all this, one of the remaining meteors will be marked with a prey marker as the boss casts _Ecliptic Meteor_ - hide behind the other remaining meteor, line-of-sighting the one that's marked. This meteor will then explode after, so move away, and the boss will cast _Beastly Fury_, a simple raidwide. The boss will then once again cast _Ravening_, bringing you into the second **Chimera's Lament** phase.\n\n## Chimera's Lament - Part 2\n\nThe second Chimera phase is much easier than the first - it's mostly combining mechanics you've already seen in different ways. This will open with another _Duality of Death_ tankbuster, handle it exactly as in the beginning. This will be followed with another _Archaic Rockbreaker_, so once again prepare for knockback into the walls with your partner. The cracked lines from **Martialist's Lament** will return here, as well as another _Dualspell_ to resolve after all of the line AoEs have resolved. _Dualspell_ here will always be Fire + Ice, so finish dodging the crack AoEs, then get into stacks with your partners either in or out based on the empowered element. After this all resolves, heal and mitigate for another _Gluttony's Augur_, and prepare for _Chimeric Succession_.\n\n### Chimeric Succession{.center}\n\n\u003eThe second Succession mechanic is much easier to resolve than the first. This time, the 4 marked players will be hit with large AoEs in number order, the same ones as the Defamation AoEs from Levinstrike. The 1 and 2 marked players will stand NE/NW respectively, all the way in the corners. 3 and 4 will wait slightly south of center, and swap in as 1 and 2 go off (1 swaps with 3, 2 swaps with 4).\n\u003e\n\u003eWhile the marked players are dealing with this, the rest of the party will stack South, just outside the second ring. The boss will cast _Front/Rear Firestrikes_, jumping to the party and dealing stack damage after the cast ends. After the jump, there will be a short amount of time to turn the boss before he casts _Swinging Kick_, doing either a front or back cleave depending on which _Firestrikes_ was cast. For _Rear Firestrikes_, the party should move North so that the boss will turn towards them and cleave outside the arena. For _Front Firestrikes_, the party should wiggle further South towards the wall to bait the cleave outside the arena, then move out of the way once _Swinging Kick_ starts to be cast.\n\nAfter _Chimeric Succession_, there will be another _Two Minds_, followed by another _Ravening_ to transition into the second and final **Mage's Lament**.\n\n## Mage's Lament - Part 2\n\nThe second mage phase has nothing new. There will be three completely random _Dualspell_ casts to resolve, with a _Gluttony's Augur_ raidwide and _Duality of Death_ tankbuster after the first and second _Dualspells_. After this, there will be one last transition into Chimera, and the _**Disintegrate**_ enrage cast will begin.","lastmodified":"2023-09-28T00:05:58.538739259Z","tags":null},"/notes/Paladin":{"title":"Paladin","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-09-28T00:05:58.538739259Z","tags":null},"/notes/Ranged-Resources":{"title":"Ranged Resources","content":"## Job Resources\n- [Dancer](notes/Dancer)\n- [Bard](notes/Bard)\n- [Machinist](notes/Machinist)\n\n## General Resources","lastmodified":"2023-09-28T00:05:58.538739259Z","tags":null},"/notes/Reaper":{"title":"Reaper","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-09-28T00:05:58.538739259Z","tags":null},"/notes/Red-Mage":{"title":"Red Mage","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-09-28T00:05:58.538739259Z","tags":null},"/notes/Sage":{"title":"Sage","content":"# Openers\n\nIn both of the below openers, any _Dosis III_ can be replaced with _Toxicon II_.

What follows is purely my opinion based on my experience from maining SGE as my healer for all of Endwalker after snorting the leveling process in less than 12 hours post-launch.\n\n## General Overview\n\nOverall, Sage is a job that has a tool for every occasion - whether you need a quick top-up, stacked mitigation, or emergency shields, chances are you've got a button that can fill that gap. One thing you'll quickly discover is that sometimes, the answer to two or more things is the same button. A majority of SGE's kit has two or three effects that it applies, for example:\n\nThe main usage of _Holos_ is to provide a lengthy 20s of 10% mitigation (analogous to WHM's _Temperance_ or SCH's _Fey Illumination_), however, it also provides a 300 potency heal AND equal amount of shielding. Optimally, you'd want to use this when the party isn't fully topped off, and will be receiving significant raidwide damage within the next 20 seconds.\n\nThe scenarios in which you can actually get the full value of all three features of _Holos_ are very far and few in between. Like, it's happened to me a total of twice in the past 2 tiers so far.\n\nOptimization on Sage is all about pushing your skills to their limits - can you sneak in that _Kerachole_ at juuuuust the last second before damage goes out so that you get the full 15s of regen ticking to top off the party? Can you get a _Physis II + Ixochole_ combo out in time to top off the party with the buffed initial heal, and then allow the regen to handle things after? Can you time your _Panhaima_ just right such that the last 2 charges expire right as a bleed finishes and handles topping off the party for you? Every time you use a cooldown, you should be thinking \"is there any feature of this cooldown that I'm not getting full value from here, and is there any way I could?\"\n\nSometimes, that answer is no - **and that's okay.** SGE likes to be constantly working, and it's very common that you'll have to choose between getting slightly less value from an ability, or losing a use of it. In general, the first is ALWAYS preferable, since any value is better than no value. This includes your Addersgall actions - if you find yourself overcapping and you aren't using GCD heals to cover, blow those suckers. Doesn't even matter on who. I routinely throw 3-4 _Druocholes_ per fight on myself purely to keep that countdown rolling and regain some mana.\n\n## Tips \u0026 Tricks\n\n- _Physis II_ and _Krasis_ affect all healing, meaning GCDs, oGCDs, other healer's abilities, even party abilities like _Arcane Crest_ and _Curing Waltz_. Don't underestimate the power of throwing out your _Physis_ and waiting to see what everyone else has in the bank. This also means that if you're planning to double up _Physis II_ and _Kerachole_ (for example, but this applies for anything you're using in conjunction with it), it's usually a good idea to pop that _Physis_ first so that you're also buffing the _Kerachole_ regen. This can sometimes be enough to just solo heal up after a raidwide with a long period between the next incoming damage.\n\n- Work **with** your co-healer, always. For a large part of content prior to Savage, this isn't fully required - normals are obviously fairly easy comparatively, and even EX fights don't require tight coordination (with older ones even being possible to solo heal at this point). However, SGE really shines when efficiently utilizing its kit to supplement and buff your co-healer, rather than focusing on raw throughput. WHM is a fantastic natural complement to SGE, as it's incredibly easy to pair _Physis II_ with a lily or _Assize_ , or take advantage of _Asylum_'s healing buff as well to really pump as much power as you can into those WHM heals.\n\n- This is more of a general healing tip, but dovetailing with the previous point, it can be incredibly helpful to coordinate with your co-healer on who \"owns\" which tank. Obviously this isn't a hard and fast rule, but focusing the bulk of your attention on a specific tank for things like split tankbusters makes dealing with those MUCH easier. Because of _Kardia_, you will often want to take the tank who is going to be taking the most autos - groups often use MT and OT, but this terminology doesn't REALLY work in FFXIV where tank swaps can mean the time is split 50/50. If you find that you have more resources than your co-healer for one of those splits (which can happen a lot when you're not needing to single-target spot heal much), throw some stuff out to help them. For example, I often throw up a _Haima_ or _Soteria_ on \"my\" tank for DoTs, but also toss out a _Krasis_ to the other tank to help my co-healer if I don't need it.\n\n- Swap your _Kardia_ target. You can change it every 5 seconds, and it's **intended** to be moved around. In a fight where there's aggro swaps for who's taking autos, swap your Kardia target to the active tank. If the tank is doing fine but you've got a DPS whose health is lagging behind and have a bit before new damage, give them the green mark of shame. If utilized properly, it can account for over 15% of your total healing, which is HUGE in a kit as diverse as SGE's.","lastmodified":"2023-09-28T00:05:58.538739259Z","tags":null},"/notes/Samurai":{"title":"Samurai","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-09-28T00:05:58.538739259Z","tags":null},"/notes/Scholar":{"title":"Scholar","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-09-28T00:05:58.538739259Z","tags":null},"/notes/Summoner":{"title":"Summoner","content":"# Openers\n## Garuda Opener\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/smn_ew_fast_garuda.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin: 0em\" alt=\"Fast Garuda Opener\"\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\nGain when group is heavy in 15s buffs and you can clip Slipstream under the buff window.

Shift Ruin III + IV before CC to adjust without loss.\n\u003e - For buff windows after Devour, try to align Titan into buff windows.\n\u003e - If killtime allows, delay ED for buff windows. \n\n### P6S\n\u003e Full uptime, use all on CD. Can pot at 2/8 for 4 Festers, if you kill before 8 use standard 0/6.\n\n### P7S\n\u003e - Hold SL at 2min window before second Immortal's Obol\n\u003e - Immortal's Obol forces a 1 GCD loss, make sure to take this into account for Demi timing\n\u003e - For slower killtimes (near enrage), 0/5/10 pot timing is optimal with 5 min being used during Phoenix window. If you will not gain a third use, 0/6 as standard.\n\n### P8S I\n\u003e If snake phase first -\u003e use phoenix before the second leg phase (downtime) and condense primals after the downtime at enrage. Pot at 0/6 mins.\n\n### P8S II\n\u003e Drop R3 leading into HC1. Drop R3 and 3 Emerald Rites leading into HC2. Use phoenix and Energy Drain immediately after High Concept 2. By using both on CD, you will gain an extra use before enrage. Use Searing where your group is using buffs. \n\n## Asphodelos\n### P1S\n\u003e Standard 100% uptime. Place pet center for both Intemperances so Searing Light will reach everyone, don’t run out too quickly or you’ll miss buffs. Nothing else to mention here!\n\n### P2S\n\u003e 1st GCD Bahamut opener, pot at 2:00 for 4 festers, 2nd pot around 6:30 window. Use Bahamut/Phoenix on cooldown. Save Searing Light for after Kampeos Harma.\n\n### P3S \n\u003e - Pot at 2:00 for 4 festers, + condensed all 3 primals (~2 GCDs per primal, summoning the next one as soon as it's available) before add phase. 2nd pot at Fountain of fire. \n\u003e - With 2nd GCD Bahamut opener, use Phoenix on time. With 1st GCD, delay Phoenix by 1 GCD. Do not delay more than this. Revelation can cleave 1st vulnerable fire if timed late in 5th GCD of Phoenix. Brand  of purgatory as your last GCD of Phoenix to hit 3+ targets if they are still alive.\n\u003e - 2:00 window, delay all festers to hit in raid buffs at no cost. Rush 3 primals: garuda -\u003e Titan -\u003e Ifrit.\n\u003e - Add phase: use Phoenix wave 1, primals wave 2.\n\u003e - Reopener, pot not recommended here because of earlier pot timing. Pot at fountain of fire or post tornados.\n\n### P4S I\n\u003e 100% uptime, standard rotation is optimal. Delay Searing Light at 2:00 if group is delaying. Otherwise, use everything on cooldown.\n\n### P4S II\n\u003e 100% uptime. Delay Searing Light at Act 2 and Act 4 by 1 GCD and place pet center so Searing Light hits everyone.\n\n## Links\n- [SMN Gear Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v4qZAPwzANTt4sOqkwi75apbjiNPXlNjYtA5NlW6uhM/edit#gid=635680971)","lastmodified":"2023-09-28T00:05:58.538739259Z","tags":null},"/notes/Tank-Resources":{"title":"Tank Resources","content":"## Jobs\n- [Dark Knight](notes/Dark%20Knight)\n- [Gunbreaker](notes/Gunbreaker)\n- [Paladin](notes/Paladin)\n- [Warrior](notes/Warrior)\n\n## General Resources","lastmodified":"2023-09-28T00:05:58.538739259Z","tags":null},"/notes/The-Epic-of-Alexander-Ultimate":{"title":"The Epic of Alexander Ultimate","content":"---\n# Encounter Info\n## Drops\n**Chest One** | **Chest Two** | **Guaranteed**","lastmodified":"2023-09-28T00:05:58.538739259Z","tags":null},"/notes/Ultima-Weapon-Ultimate":{"title":"Ultima Weapon Ultimate","content":"---\n## Encounter Info\n### Drops\n**Chest One** | **Chest Two** | **Guaranteed**","lastmodified":"2023-09-28T00:05:58.538739259Z","tags":null},"/notes/Ultimate":{"title":"Ultimate","content":"## Fights in tier:\n\n- [Ultima Weapon Ultimate](notes/Ultima%20Weapon%20Ultimate)\n- [Ultimate Coils of Bahamut](notes/Ultimate%20Coils%20of%20Bahamut)\n- [The Epic of Alexander Ultimate](notes/The%20Epic%20of%20Alexander%20Ultimate)\n- [Dragonsong War Ultimate](notes/Dragonsong%20War%20Ultimate)\n\n## General Tier Info","lastmodified":"2023-09-28T00:05:58.538739259Z","tags":null},"/notes/Ultimate-Coils-of-Bahamut":{"title":"Ultimate Coils of Bahamut","content":"---\n## Encounter Info\n### Drops\n**Chest One** | **Chest Two** | **Guaranteed**","lastmodified":"2023-09-28T00:05:58.538739259Z","tags":null},"/notes/Warrior":{"title":"Warrior","content":"## Openers\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003cp class=\"center\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/notes/images/war_opener.png\" width=\"60%\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n## Gear sets\n\n\n\n## Links","lastmodified":"2023-09-28T00:05:58.538739259Z","tags":null},"/notes/White-Mage":{"title":"White Mage","content":"# Gear Sets\n\n## Pre-Raid BiS\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003ciframe \n\t\twidth=\"90.75%\" \n\t\theight=\"1000\" \n\t\tsrc=\"https://etro.gg/embed/gearset/fd3cef15-74c2-43c3-b8b0-47fa581e5f7a\" \n\t\ttitle=\"\" \n\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n## Savage BiS Options\n### 2.44 Mid-Piety\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003ciframe \n\t\twidth=\"90.75%\" \n\t\theight=\"1000\" \n\t\tsrc=\"https://etro.gg/embed/gearset/e2fc82de-9629-48fd-ad46-5b13be00aaba\" \n\t\ttitle=\"\" \n\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}\n\n### 2.42 Low-Piety\n\n{{\u003c rawhtml \u003e}}\n\u003ciframe \n\t\twidth=\"90.75%\" \n\t\theight=\"1000\" \n\t\tsrc=\"https://etro.gg/embed/gearset/a7cb866f-6a5f-4744-b682-dddba4339143\" \n\t\ttitle=\"\" \n\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n{{\u003c /rawhtml \u003e}}","lastmodified":"2023-09-28T00:05:58.538739259Z","tags":null}}
