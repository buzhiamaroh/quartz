# Strategy Reference

Kokytus opens with 2 raidwides - _Gluttony's Augur_, which simply deals moderate damage, followed shortly by _Ravening_, which deals moderate damage and signals a phase transition. These phases are always in order, starting with **Mage's Lament**.

## Mage's Lament - Part 1

### Overview

The first Mage phase (denoted by the Blue buff on the boss) will open with a 2-hit AoE tankbuster on both tanks that will require a swap (_Duality of Death_) - make sure to be NW/NE away from the party, and provoke during the castbar.

Directly following will be a series of three _Dualspell_ casts (explained below). The element order on these is fixed to always be Fire > Lightning > Fire, but which element is empowered is random, with the exception that the 1st and the 3rd will always be opposite each other (so if Ice is empowered first, Fire will be empowered second).

The final _Dualspell_ is the end of this phase, and the boss will cast _Ravening_ once more to transition into **Martialist's Lament**.

#### Dualspell{.center}

>The boss will begin charging two elements that can be seen on his hands - this will always be a combination of an Ice element donut AoE, and either Fire (AoE on 4 random players, always all DPS or all support), or Lightning (line AoE on every player). Getting hit by any of these leaves a magic vuln, so if you get hit by 2 (either by getting clipped by the Ice donut, or overlapping the baited AoEs), you will die.
>
>Each Dualspell cast will also have one of the two elements be empowered, indicated by a colored sigil that matches the element flashing on the screen (Blue for Ice, Red for Fire, and Purple for Lightning). Whichever element is empowered will end up having a much larger AoE effect, just like in Normal.
>
>Combining this, essentially what this means is you have 2 pieces of information you need to solve the mechanic - Fire vs. Lightning (partner stacks vs. clocks), and Ice or Not Ice (in or out).

## Martialist's Lament

This phase will open with 4 walls being spawned on either cardinals or intercardinals, followed by _Ascendant Fist_, a single-hit tankbuster that will apply a DoT and Physical vuln effect, requiring a tank swap.

Immediately after, the boss will cast _Archaic Rockbreaker_ - this will cause a knockback from the center of the arena that has a pushback greater than the distance to the edge of the arena. To resolve this, you'll need to get knocked back into the walls that have spawned with your same partner from Fire in _Dualspell_. This knockback is followed by a 2-person stack AoE.

This is followed up immediately again by either _Front Combination_ or _Rear Combination_. There will either be a donut (in) or point blank (out) indicator on the floor, followed by a 180-degree cleave either in front or behind the boss (signaled by the cast name), which is then followed by the opposite to the first AoE.
