# Strategy Reference

Kokytus opens with 2 raidwides - _Gluttony's Augur_, which simply deals moderate raidwide damage, followed shortly by _Ravening_, which signals a phase transition, and deals moderate raidwide damage after a 5 second delay. These phases are always in order, starting with **Mage's Lament**.

## Mage's Lament - Part 1

The first Mage phase (denoted by the Blue buff on the boss) will open with a 2-hit AoE tankbuster on both tanks that will require a swap (_Duality of Death_) - make sure to be NW/NE away from the party, and provoke during the castbar.

Directly following will be a series of three _Dualspell_ casts (explained below). The element order on these is fixed to always be Fire > Lightning > Fire, but which element is empowered is random, with the exception that the 1st and the 3rd will always be opposite each other (so if Ice is empowered first, Fire will be empowered second).

The final _Dualspell_ is the end of this phase, and the boss will cast _Ravening_ once more to transition into **Martialist's Lament**.

#### Dualspell{.center}

>The boss will begin charging two elements that can be seen on his hands - this will always be a combination of an Ice element donut AoE, and either Fire (AoE on 4 random players, always all DPS or all support), or Lightning (line AoE on every player). Getting hit by any of these leaves a magic vuln, so if you get hit by 2 (either by getting clipped by the Ice donut, or overlapping the baited AoEs), you will die.
>
>Each Dualspell cast will also have one of the two elements be empowered, indicated by a colored sigil that matches the element flashing on the screen (Blue for Ice, Red for Fire, and Purple for Lightning). Whichever element is empowered will end up having a much larger AoE effect, just like in Normal.
>
>Combining this, essentially what this means is you have 2 pieces of information you need to solve the mechanic - Fire vs. Lightning (partner stacks vs. clocks), and Ice or Not Ice (in or out).

## Martialist's Lament

This phase will open with 4 walls being spawned on either cardinals or intercardinals, followed by _Ascendant Fist_, a single-hit tankbuster that will apply a DoT and Physical vuln effect, requiring a tank swap.

Immediately after, the boss will cast _Archaic Rockbreaker_ - this will cause a knockback from the center of the arena that has a pushback greater than the distance to the edge of the arena. To resolve this, you'll need to get knocked back into the walls that have spawned with your same partner from Fire in _Dualspell_. This knockback is followed by a 2-person stack AoE.

This is followed up immediately again by either _Front Combination_ or _Rear Combination_. There will either be a donut (in) or point blank (out) indicator on the floor, followed by a 180-degree cleave either in front or behind the boss (signaled by the cast name), which is then followed by the opposite to the first AoE. This essentially means there's a total of four possible patterns:

> Donut > Front OR Rear cleave > Point blank
>
>OR
>
>Point blank > Front OR Rear cleave > Donut

At the same time that _Front/Rear Combination_ AoEs are going off, there will be cracks on the floor that have glowing lines growing through them. When these lines reach their end, they'll explode in a large AoE around the tip, meaning you'll have to dodge both at once. This will happen twice, and both times the AoEs from the lines will go off at the same time as the in/out from _Combination_. There will be a split second to adjust before the line AoEs explode, but the snapshot is very tight.

Because you're dodging both at once, there's an easy way to simplify safe spots - if the _Combination_ AoE is in, stand ON the long lines and away from the short lines. If it's out, stand on the wall near the short lines and AWAY from the long lines.

After all of this, there will be _Archaic Demolish_, a simple light party stack on both healers, followed by a _Gluttony's Augur_ raidwide and another _Ascendant Fist_ tankbuster. There is very little time between the stacks and raidwide, so this is a good place for heavy mit. If you've gotten past all this, it's time for **Chimera's Lament**, also known as Blitzball.
