# Openers

In both of the below openers, any _Dosis III_ can be replaced with _Toxicon II_. I tend to shield pre-pull and then use _Toxicon II_ directly before the first _Phlegma III_ because I like the sound it makes when you get an Addersting stack. (It does also allow you to weave more freely, but that's not why I do it).

## Pneuma Opener
{{< figure src="/notes/images/SGE-Pneuma.png" link="/notes/images/SGE-Pneuma.png" class="center" width="90%" caption="> This opener should only be used if you aren't going to be using Pneuma in the first 2 minutes of the fight - if either healer is needing to use a GCD heal to cover damage that could have been covered with Pneuma, don't use this opener.">}}

> Identical to WHM 2.45, this is the highest DPS option. If you find yourself struggling with mana, first try optimizing your oGCDs (more on that in a moment). If you've done that and still have mana issues, check out the piety sets below.
