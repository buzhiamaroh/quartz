# Openers

In both of the below openers, any _Dosis III_ can be replaced with _Toxicon II_. I tend to shield pre-pull and then use _Toxicon II_ directly before the first _Phlegma III_ because I like the sound it makes when you get an Addersting stack. (It does also allow you to weave more freely, but that's not why I do it).

> Identical to WHM 2.45, this is the highest DPS option. If you find yourself struggling with mana, first try optimizing your oGCDs (more on that in a moment). If you've done that and still have mana issues, check out the piety sets below.

# Optimization

I'm going to start this section by saying that you should absolutely never full-heartedly take another person's healing advice in FFXIV, not even mine. What follows is purely my opinion based on my experience from maining SGE as my healer for all of Endwalker after snorting the leveling process in less than 12 hours post-launch.

## General Overview

Overall, Sage is a job that has a tool for every occasion - whether you need a quick top-up, stacked mitigation, or emergency shields, chances are you've got a button that can fill that gap. One thing you'll quickly discover is that sometimes, the answer to two or more things is the same button. A majority of SGE's kit has two or three effects that it applies, for example:

The main usage of _Holos_ is to provide a lengthy 20s of 10% mitigation (analogous to WHM's _Temperance_ or SCH's _Fey Illumination_), however, it also provides a 300 potency heal AND equal amount of shielding. Optimally, you'd want to use this when the party isn't fully topped off, and will be receiving significant raidwide damage within the next 20 seconds.

The scenarios in which you can actually get the full value of all three features of _Holos_ are very far and few in between. Like, it's happened to me a total of twice in the past 2 tiers so far.

Optimization on Sage is all about pushing your skills to their limits - can you sneak in that _Kerachole_ at juuuuust the last second before damage goes out so that you get the full 15s of regen ticking to top off the party? Can you get a _Physis II + Ixochole_ combo out in time to top off the party with the buffed initial heal, and then allow the regen to handle things after? Can you time your _Panhaima_ just right such that the last 2 charges expire right as a bleed finishes and handles topping off the party for you? Every time you use a cooldown, you should be thinking "is there any feature of this cooldown that I'm not getting full value from here, and is there any way I could?"

Sometimes, that answer is no - **and that's okay.** SGE likes to be constantly working, and it's very common that you'll have to choose between getting slightly less value from an ability, or losing a use of it. In general, the first is ALWAYS preferable, since any value is better than no value. This includes your Addersgall actions - if you find yourself overcapping and you aren't using GCD heals to cover, blow those suckers. Doesn't even matter on who. I routinely throw 3-4 _Druocholes_ per fight on myself purely to keep that countdown rolling and regain some mana.

## Tips & Tricks

- _Physis II_ and _Krasis_ affect all healing, meaning GCDs, oGCDs, other healer's abilities, even party abilities like _Arcane Crest_ and _Curing Waltz_. Don't underestimate the power of throwing out your _Physis_ and waiting to see what everyone else has in the bank.

- Work **with** your co-healer, always. For a large part of content prior to Savage,
