Welcome to DESU!

**What is DESU?** 

DESU is a community aiming to build up the Party Finder experience on Dynamis, and to provide a wealth of resources for everyone looking to tackle any and all of the high-end combat content this game has to offer - together.

**Our main objectives:**

1. Getting into endgame content, Savage especially, can be daunting. DESU wants to be a place where players who are new to all this can feel they have a safe place to ask questions and be happily welcomed into the community!

2. In addition to welcoming new players, we hope to help experienced players have some fun close to home. Especially as our DC finds its legs, finding groups can be hard. DESU helps folks get in touch - whether you're searching for pick-up groups, trying to get stuff unlocked, or seeking people to play with on a more regular basis.

**Getting Started**

To get into DESU, you have to clear the door boss: @KupoBot. If you haven't already registered with KupoBot on another server, or if you recently transferred, head over to #add-character to get your character set up. Once you're registered, you can head to ⁠#assign-roles to select roles. You'll find pingable roles for specific fights, mentorship and learning roles, and more. If you're interested in hearing about minor updates to the server, be sure to grab the @TunedIn role. From there you should be all set to head over to ⁠general and say hi, tell us more about youself in ⁠introductions if you like, or even jump right into ⁠party-finder!
