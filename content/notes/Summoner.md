## Openers
> In both of the below openers, the 1st GCD Ruin III (directly after Searing Light) can be cut to push Bahamut out earlier (referred to henceforth as 1st GCD Bahamut). Note that optimal oGCD timings will change when using this variation - the important part is simply to ensure that all oGCDs fall within raid buffs.

### Garuda Opener

Gain when group is heavy in 15s buffs and you can clip Slipstream under the buff window. Otherwise, use Titan opener below.

	The image above is outdated, this sequence <em>only</em> works if you use the 1st GCD Bahamut variation. <br><br> Otherwise, Slipstream is not snapshotted under 15s buffs and the gain is lost.

## Gear sets

All builds are viable and competitive with each other. Crit builds are better in full uptime scenarios and better at aligning with buffs, but the speed SMN playstyle is still a viable option if you prefer it.

## Optimization
### P1S
> Standard 100% uptime. Place pet center for both Intemperances so Searing Light will reach everyone, don’t run out too quickly or you’ll miss buffs. Nothing else to mention here!

### P2S
> 1st GCD Bahamut opener, pot at 2:00 for 4 festers, 2nd pot around 6:30 window. Use Bahamut/Phoenix on cooldown. Save Searing Light for after Kampeos Harma.

### P3S 
> - Pot at 2:00 for 4 festers, + condensed all 3 primals (~2 GCDs per primal, summoning the next one as soon as it's available) before add phase. 2nd pot at Fountain of fire. 
> - With 2nd GCD Bahamut opener, use Phoenix on time. With 1st GCD, delay Phoenix by 1 GCD. Do not delay more than this. Revelation can cleave 1st vulnerable fire if timed late in 5th GCD of Phoenix. Brand  of purgatory as your last GCD of Phoenix to hit 3+ targets if they are still alive.
> - 2:00 window, delay all festers to hit in raid buffs at no cost. Rush 3 primals: garuda -> Titan -> Ifrit.
> - Add phase: use Phoenix wave 1, primals wave 2.
> - Reopener, pot not recommended here because of earlier pot timing. Pot at fountain of fire or post tornados.

### P4S I
> 100% uptime, standard rotation is optimal. Delay Searing Light at 2:00 if group is delaying. Otherwise, use everything on cooldown.

### P4S II
> 100% uptime. Delay Searing Light at Act 2 and Act 4 by 1 GCD and place pet center so Searing Light hits everyone.
