Gain when group is heavy in 15s buffs and you can clip Slipstream under the buff window. Otherwise, use Titan opener below.

# Gear sets

All builds are viable and competitive with each other. Crit builds are better in full uptime scenarios and better at aligning with buffs, but the speed SMN playstyle is still a viable option if you prefer it.

# Optimization

## Abyssos
### P5S
> Use demis on CD, hold SL for after Devour

### P6S
> Full uptime, use all on CD.

### P7S
> - Hold SL at 2min window before second Immortal's Obol
> - Immortal's Obol forces a 1 GCD loss, make sure to take this into account for Demi timing

### P8S I

### P8S II

## Asphodelos
### P1S
> Standard 100% uptime. Place pet center for both Intemperances so Searing Light will reach everyone, don’t run out too quickly or you’ll miss buffs. Nothing else to mention here!

### P2S
> 1st GCD Bahamut opener, pot at 2:00 for 4 festers, 2nd pot around 6:30 window. Use Bahamut/Phoenix on cooldown. Save Searing Light for after Kampeos Harma.

### P3S 
> - Pot at 2:00 for 4 festers, + condensed all 3 primals (~2 GCDs per primal, summoning the next one as soon as it's available) before add phase. 2nd pot at Fountain of fire. 
> - With 2nd GCD Bahamut opener, use Phoenix on time. With 1st GCD, delay Phoenix by 1 GCD. Do not delay more than this. Revelation can cleave 1st vulnerable fire if timed late in 5th GCD of Phoenix. Brand  of purgatory as your last GCD of Phoenix to hit 3+ targets if they are still alive.
> - 2:00 window, delay all festers to hit in raid buffs at no cost. Rush 3 primals: garuda -> Titan -> Ifrit.
> - Add phase: use Phoenix wave 1, primals wave 2.
> - Reopener, pot not recommended here because of earlier pot timing. Pot at fountain of fire or post tornados.

### P4S I
> 100% uptime, standard rotation is optimal. Delay Searing Light at 2:00 if group is delaying. Otherwise, use everything on cooldown.

### P4S II
> 100% uptime. Delay Searing Light at Act 2 and Act 4 by 1 GCD and place pet center so Searing Light hits everyone.
