# Strategy Reference

**Pandæmonium** opens the fight with your typical raidwide, this time _Ultima_. There's a decently spicy DoT attached to this, but it's not too bad if mitigated. Immediately following is _Soul Grasp_, a multi-hit stacked tankbuster. The last bit of bleed is still ticking during this, so watch out for your tanks. Once this is done, heal up to prepare for the first _Dividing Wings_.

## Dividing Wings I

There's technically two separate mechanics here that are combining into one resolution - _Dividing Wings_, which spawns two winged staves that will tether to one random support and one random DPS and shoot a wide cleave AoE at them (looks to be about 120°), and _Steel Web_, which will mark 2 other random support/DPS players with a stack AoE that will form webs between the affected players.

There's a couple different ways to resolve this, but my favorite is with the tethered players North. The tethered players will stand 2 tiles North and 1 tile closer to the outside from their staff, and the remaining players will role stack in a triangle formation with the stack AoE players 1 tile to the outside from the staves (see diagram).

{{< figure src="/notes/images/p10s_dividing1.png" link="/notes/images/p10s_dividing1.png" class="center" width="60%" >}}

Once this all goes off, the players hit by _Steel Web_ will be tethered together by, well, webs. The free players will need to run through these webs to break them and free the tethered players. Additionally, the players hit by the wing cleaves will get another DoT on them - this one isn't TOO spicy, but you will need to keep an eye on it.

This is followed by either a _Pandæmon's Holy_ or _Circles of Pandæmonium_ cast - _Holy_ is a point blank (out), and _Circles_ is a donut (in).

## Wicked Step

After all this is _Wicked Step_. These will be tank towers on the left and right of the arena, with a twist - the towers will send you flying in a line from their origin point. Oh, and there's a decently spicy DoT this time, beware. To resolve, the tanks will soak the towers to the north and closer to the center (so, West tower is soaked with the tank NE, and vice versa) to be knocked back to the opposite small platform.

To get the tanks back home, the boss will helpfully cast _Entangling Web_. Both tanks, a random healer, and a random DPS will be targeted with web AoE baits. If you bait these such that they overlap both one of the pillars on either side of the gap, and each other, they'll create a web bridge to walk across the poison puddles. In general, healers go left, DPS go right, it's not too hard.

{{< figure src="/notes/images/p10s_entangling_web.png" link="/notes/images/p10s_entangling_web.png" class="center" width="60%" caption="The main thing to watch out for is that the AoE puddles **need** to overlap a bit - if they don't, a bridge won't be formed.">}}

## Pandæmoniac Pillars

Once the web bridges are formed, everyone mosey back center for _Pandæmoniac Pillars_ - these will be tower soaks, follow your positions from [Setup](notes/P10S%20-%20Pandæmonium#Setup). After soaking your towers, cheat back close to the middle, and watch for the castbar. The boss will once again cast either _Holy_ or _Circles_, making either the front or middle row safe, and then the towers will randomly spawn either donut or point blank AoEs. This happens **VERY** quickly, and you don't have much time to adjust - I've found the easiest way to solve this is to cheat towards the safe lane before the towers appear, then keep an eye out for the large ones with chains (the point blanks). They're much easier to see at a glance than the donuts, so you can just dodge away from those into a donut tower.
