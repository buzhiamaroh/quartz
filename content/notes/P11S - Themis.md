# Strategy Reference

Themis opens the fight with some pretty standard stuff, starting with an _Eunomia_ raidwide that has a bleed. This is decently spicy, so make sure to keep an eye on that. Immediately after is _Dike_, a 2-hit tankbuster on both tanks that requires a swap during the castbar. We then start in on the first set of _Overruling_ mechanics.

## Phase 1

There are a total of four different _Overruling_ mechanics throughout the fight - since the main difference between all of them is the first word, I'm going to just refer to them with that after introducing them. The main commonality between all of them is that Themis will glow with either **Light** or **Dark** energy while casting the mechanic to indicate one of two possible patterns.

In general, **Light** versions of _Overrulings_ will result in going away from a point-blank AoE and soaking in light parties, and **Dark** versions will result in going to the center of a donut AoE and soaking in partners.

>**Light** = Light parties + out
>
>**Dark** = Partners (doubles) + in

_Jury_ is the first _Overruling_ mechanic in this phase and is repeated throughout the fight. Light or Dark, it always starts with line proteans from the boss which are taken in clock spots at max melee.

**Light:** For the Light version, after proteans you'll drop point-blank AoEs underneath your positions. There will also be a light party stack, so to resolve, simply move in in your light parties.

**Dark:** For the Dark version, after proteans you'll drop donut AoEs under your positions. There are partner stacks directly after, so supports rotate clockwise to their DPS partner who stays in their clock spot.
